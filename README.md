🏥 Healthcare Claims Cost Analysis – Where Is the Money Going?
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes synthetic healthcare insurance claims data to understand where healthcare spending is concentrated and why the insurer may be losing money.

The goal is to provide clear, executive-level insights into:

High-cost claim types

Expensive CPT and ICD codes

Members driving disproportionate costs

Gaps between billed vs paid amounts

The final output is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed for C-level stakeholders to support cost-containment and profitability strategies.

🎯 Business Problem

Healthcare costs are rising, and insurers need visibility into:

Which services are most expensive

Which procedures and diagnoses drive costs

Whether paid amounts align with billed amounts

Whether a small subset of members accounts for a large share of spending

This dashboard helps identify cost leakage and concentration risk.

📊 Key Questions Answered

Which claim types (Inpatient, Emergency, Outpatient, Pharmacy) are the most expensive?

Which CPT codes drive the highest total paid amount?

Which ICD diagnosis codes clearly dominate spending?

Which members account for the highest share of total costs?

How do billed amounts compare to paid amounts across claim types?

Where does the paid-to-billed ratio indicate inefficiency or overbilling?

💡 Key Insights

Inpatient services account for the majority of total paid spend

A small subset of CPT and ICD codes drives a disproportionate share of costs

Top members contribute heavily to overall spend concentration

Paid amounts are consistently lower than billed amounts, but gaps vary by claim type

Inpatient services and a limited number of procedures and members account for most of the insurer’s total paid spend.
